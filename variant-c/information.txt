Variant C Changes
1. Changed the hero section for a different one, using one of the website's images. This image required some editing such as removing background and erasing either side so it didnt end on a sharp edge. Besides There was the need of creating an alternative version for mobile zoomed into the card so it worked better on mobile.
2. As the hero background became white there was the need of removing the transition of the navbar text and keep it dark so it didnt disappears when on top.
3. Fixed some padding issues as well.
